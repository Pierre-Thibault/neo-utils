#summary How to install the package.

= Introduction =

neo-utils is a set of utility functions and classes to be used by any Python 
application. It supports Python 2.5 and later (but not version 3).

= Installation =

The project contains only one package: neo_utils. The project is called 
neo-utils and it contains the package neo_utils. It is neo_utils that must be 
moved in the Python path. Not the neo-utils project.

If you are using it with web2py, put the project outside of the web2py 
installation. (I keep it in the Eclipse the workspace.) 

This package has no other dependency than Python itself.
